Strava is a really helpful tool that makes training fun. It's great for athletes. But what about those of us who are focused more on the act of going on the adventure than tracking the data of the adventure? The thru-hikers. The bikepackers. Even the weekend warrior car camper! That's where OFN comes in.

This project is still in its early stages. Currently my focus is on our website and blog, which is built with Go and VueJS.

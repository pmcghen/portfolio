I've been the lead front end developer for 9Rooftops (formerly MARCUSA) since 2017. During that time I've worked exclusively with the agency's biggest client, the Pennsylvania Lottery.

Our front end tech stack has been evolving over the years as I led efforts to modernize a codebase in disarray.

In addition to my development responsibilities, I also moved the team from a system of disparate tools and processes to an Agile kanban system using Trello.

When I started at 9Rooftops, our team was super disorganized. Projects were tracked in a 
single spreadsheet, and tasks were assigned through email and in-person conversations. 

As you can imagine, this led to all kinds of chaos.

It wasn't clear who was working on what at any given time. Projects could grind to a halt
if someone was out sick. Getting other members of the team up to speed when somebody needed
a hand was a chore. I saw an opportunity.

I approached my boss to discuss some ideas for improving communication within the team and 
delivering better results for our client. I chose [Trello](https://trello.com) for its 
generous free tier and low barrier to entry, while providing enough flexibility to allow us 
to scale if the experiment worked.

A few years and more than a few iterations later, we're still using Trello to track projects,
delegate work, and collect documentation and onboard new team members. I've created a public 
version of our workflow using [Outdoor Fun Network](/portfolio/outdoor-fun-network) as a template.

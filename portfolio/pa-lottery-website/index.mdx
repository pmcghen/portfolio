I've been a front end developer with 9Rooftops (formerly MARCUSA) since 2017. During that time I've worked exclusively with the agency's biggest client, the Pennsylvania Lottery. What started as a six month contract has led to a steadily expanded role that now sees me leading the front end team.

Under my leadership,

  - the front end team has undertaken initiatives to refactor and modernize an aging codebase with heavy technical debt
  - communication and collaboration with the UX team has evolved, leading to the creation of a consistent design system
  - the entire development team has moved from a disorganized SVN system with loose standards to a git workflow with a consistent branching model
  - project management has gone from shared spreadsheets outlining the entire team's workload to an Agile kanban workflow using Trello

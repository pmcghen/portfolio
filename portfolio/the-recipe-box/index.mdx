I love to cook. When I'm offline, there's a good chance I'm in the kitchen. Sometimes I'm riffing on someone else's work via my library of cookbooks. Sometimes I'm creating something of my own. Over the years I've collected (and, sadly, lost) a number of my own recipes. They're scattered through various notebooks, scraps of paper, and markdown files on my computer. What better way to learn Django than to kill two birds with one stone, right?

The Recipe Box is a simple CMS that keeps all of those random pages in one place. The VueJS front end connects to a Django REST Framework API. It's pretty bare bones right now, but future versions will allow users to log in and save their favorites, rate and comment on recipes, and share their own creations with the community.
